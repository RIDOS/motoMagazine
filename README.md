I am rewriting this project at the request of the teacher. Although I already did it in 2018 in the C# programming
language. However, now I will make it in pure PHP and using such technologies written in JavaScript. As a result of this
project, a store and an add-on for future projects will be made.

I didn't write the project entirely on my guesses. For the most part, my work helped me, as well as the video course
